## Current situation
Eiland Gasten is a creative collective of 13 people who collaborate without any form of hierarchy. Their main occupation is the organization of different types of events. They use a secret Facebook group to communicate about all the things they’re working on. This works pretty well when there is only one thing to talk about, but tends to get chaotic when there are multiple subjects to discuss.

Because a facebook group revolves around a single timeline of posts, it’s easy to overlook conversations and important announcements. Post that were submitted in the morning can get snowed under with other posts during the day. This structure makes it hard to find things back and communicate clearly.
