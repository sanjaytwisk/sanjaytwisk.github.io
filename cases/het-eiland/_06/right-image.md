## Development
Het Eiland was a way for me to learn NodeJS and VueJS. Setting up a web-application using Node, Express and MongoDB was a fun and insightfull challenge. In the start phase of the project I decided to use Socket.io for realtime notifications, posts and comments. I also figured it would be a good idea to store all the images in one cetral place, so I used the Google Drive API for node with node to store everything on Google Drive. The users log in using their facebook account, so that there is no hassle with account setup.
