## Idea
In an effort to improve communication I came up with the idea to build a self-hosted platform that works with the same priciples of a Facebook group, but uses multiple timelines to order the posts. Since the collective focusses on organizing events, they should be able to create a virtual event space where the timelines could live. In this way, every event could be discussed on its own and every subject in the discussion could have its own timeline.

The creation of a self-hosted customized web application also opens a door to improvements like planning/agenda and financial documentation.
