## Midi
So, what is MIDI? MIDI stands for “Musical Instrument Digital Interface” and is a protocol used by a variety of devices like synthesizers, drum computers and computer software to communicate with each other.

In the context of this project the controller sends control values or note values to the software on the computer using rotary encoders, buttons and faders. The signals are then interpreted and used to control the parameters or notes of a digital music devices like a synthesizer.

Using a controller is more intuitive than using a mouse and keyboard, giving the musician space to enhance his creativity and workflow.
