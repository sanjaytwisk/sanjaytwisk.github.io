## Product Design
I started by drawing different perspective sketches. They were rough idea’s on the form and properties of the first controller idea. Because the sketching didn’t trigger my creativity I very soon went to 3D modeling sofware called Cinema 4D.
I never worked with the sofware before, but its ease of use and powerful rendering engine were great for generating new idea’s and designs. After digitising the first idea’s and tweaking it over and over again I got to the final design for my controller.
