## Prototyping
I used the Arduino Uno to develop a functional prototype of my designs. The Arduino Uno prototyping board uses a simple programming interface to create prototypes on the fly. It is capable to communicate with other devices using usb and it has multiple digital and analog I/Oâ€™s.

In combination with a push button, a rotary encoder and some additional software my functional prototype came to life.
