## Concept
Bases on the capacity of existing controllers and my own competencies I came up with the idea to design an add-on controller to use next to an APC40 controller by Akai. Adding the controller to a setup with an APC40, the user has more control over his effects.

This concept was realistic and still a challenge. It consists of three rotary encoders with a LED ring. The encoders are used to control specific effects and the LED rings function as value indicators. Using a big push button the user can reset the values to their preset values
