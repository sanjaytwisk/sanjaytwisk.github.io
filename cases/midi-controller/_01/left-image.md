## The Idea
With this project I wanted to combine interaction design with my other passion: music. Based on my live performance experience with Ableton Live(software) and a MIDI controller soon came the idea to design and build my own controller. This was a great opportunity for me to design a real product and challenge myself both in the area of design and prototyping. In order to do this I had to step outside my comfort zone and learn about product design, electronics and programming.
