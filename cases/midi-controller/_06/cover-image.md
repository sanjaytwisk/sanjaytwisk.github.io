## Final Product
As you can see the final product is a simple version of the initial design. Using just one encoder and a push button was challenging enough and gives a good impression of the core function of the product.

I used the 3D model and a milling machine to create a high density foam version of my design. With this foam model I was able to form a plastic casing using a vacuum forming machine.oller.
