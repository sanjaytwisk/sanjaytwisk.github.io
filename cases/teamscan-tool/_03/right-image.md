## Team management
The participation of team members is managed by the team leader. After creating an account, the team leader is able to invite all of the team members in the “team” section of the app. A team member can  accept the invite by clicking on the link in the invite e-mail. After setting up an account password the team member logs into the application and has instant access to his own scan entry.

Ofcourse the team leader is in full control of the participation. If a team members refuses to finish the scan, the team leader has the option to remove the member from the application.
