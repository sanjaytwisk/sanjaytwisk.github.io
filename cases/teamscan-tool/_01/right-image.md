## Current situation
In the current situation, the coach uses a printed version of the team scan. The scan, containing more than 120 multiple choice questions, has to be printed for each member of the team. The analysis of the results happens digitally, which means the coach has to fill in all the values in an excel document. This document is then used to plot the combined results of all the team members on different graphs. This process is time-consuming and hard to manage.
