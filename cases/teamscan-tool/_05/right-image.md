## Interactive scan
The scan is devided into eleven sections of which ten are filled with multiple choice and one with open questions. The ten multiple choice sections are devided into subsections for detailed reflection in the results.

Every section is displayed on its own page, so that the user has a clear understanding of where he is. If a user decides to stop, his results will be saved per section, so that he can resume the scan another time. The blue top bar shows a progress indicator on the right, so that the user has insight in his progress.
