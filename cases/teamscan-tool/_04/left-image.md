## Scans
The “scan” page displays an overview of all the scans. Every scan shows the date of the scan, the amount of participating members and the amount of members who finished the scan. The result of the scan will be made available for the whole team after all the team members are done. While members can only start or resume a scan, the team leaders has permission to initiate a new scan for the team.
