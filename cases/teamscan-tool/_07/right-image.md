## Development
I used Laravel to develop the final product. This was the first time I built a web-application from scratch (including the back-end), so it was a real challenge. Besides learning back-end stuff, I used this project to improve my JavaScript skills implementing Object Oriented JavaScript. I started the project using SCSS widh CodeKit, but later on I switched to Gulp for more flexibility. Iâ€™m particularly proud of this project, because I managed to teach myself to be a more allround developer.
