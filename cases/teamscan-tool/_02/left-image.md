## Concept
The base concept is a web-application that facilitates an interactive version of the team scan, so that the scan is filled in online and the results are automatically bundled into a team report. This saves te coach a significant amount of time.

With the interactive team scan, the teamleader should manage the distribution of the scan amongst the team members. Team members should be able to fill in the scan individually at any given time.
